  <p>What is this blog about? What's my purpose for building it? </p>
  <p>Well, it's all about sharing my thoughts. Sometimes I have some interesting ideas glowing in my head but they always fade away into the darkness silently. It could be my dreams about how amazing golden elevators spinning in the stock exchange market where white paper flies everywhere (well that is just one of my crazy dreams). It could be my feelings when listening to Rachmaninoff&#39;s piano concerto. Or it could be what I have learnt (CS, Math, game design?).</p>
  <p>These thoughts can be irrelevant to you, but those are part of my life experiences. They are solid evidences of what I have seen and felt. As I recognized that death is not far away from everyone, I hope these real and beautiful thoughts should stay here for a while. Somehow they proved to myself that I have made something. </p>
  <p>I wish I had a place to record my colorful emotions. So that's why this blog is about everything. If you are reading this text now, I hope you'll find something interesting. And always, I'll be happy to hear from you. Let's chat, shall we?</p>
  <p>Oh, who am I? Currently a student! (That's all thanks! <strong>(/へ＼*)</strong> )</p>
